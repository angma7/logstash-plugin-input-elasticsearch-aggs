# logstash-plugin-input-elasticsearch-aggs
## Environment 
### Elasticsearch : 1.4.2
### Logstash : 1.4.3

## Purpose
Legacy logstash-input-elasticsearch plugin has not been supporting Aggregation query. This plugin is just support to aggregation query. 
This plugin is developed based on  "Logstasn-input-elasticsearh".  

Complied binary is "logstash-input-elasticsearch-1.0.2.gem". 
Currently I didn't change plugin name. Because this  is implemented as a interanl project.
